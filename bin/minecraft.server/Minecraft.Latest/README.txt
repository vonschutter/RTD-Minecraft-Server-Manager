This is the Minecraft server root folder. Just place the minecraft.jar file here and place the minecraft.server file in the root of the home or the bin folder... 

The start.sh file will start the minecraft server with the right options and the announce.py will announce it on the local network. 

Using the minecraft.server script will start the monitoring screen for the server and start the local network announce as well as the server.
